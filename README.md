## Project Overview

HomeHarmony is a household management application built with Next.js and Firebase. Its primary goal is to simplify the management of chores and expenses within a household. The application offers a range of features to facilitate collaboration and organization among household members.

**Key Technologies Used:**

-   **Frontend:** Next.js (A powerful React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications)
-   **Backend:** Firebase (Google's comprehensive mobile and web development platform, used here for Authentication, Firestore Database, and Cloud Functions)
-   **AI:** Genkit (A framework for building AI applications, likely used for the chore and expense optimization features)
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, PostCSS
-   **Language:** TypeScript

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a modern technology stack to deliver a robust and efficient household management solution:

-   **Next.js:** A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, providing performance optimizations and a great developer experience.
-   **Firebase:** A comprehensive backend-as-a-service platform that simplifies building web applications. We utilize Firebase Authentication for user management, Firestore as a NoSQL database for storing household data, and Cloud Functions for serverless backend logic.
-   **Genkit:** A framework designed to build AI applications. It is integrated into this project to power the intelligent chore scheduling and expense splitting features, enabling dynamic suggestions and optimizations.
-   **Tailwind CSS and PostCSS:** Used for efficient and utility-first CSS styling, allowing for rapid UI development and a consistent design.
-   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and helps catch errors during development.

## Core Features:

-   **Household Management:** Allows users to create and manage distinct household profiles. Within each household, members can be added, and roles (e.g., administrator, member) can be assigned to control permissions and responsibilities.
-   **Chore Rotation Scheduler:** Provides a flexible system for defining household chores, setting their desired frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), and automatically assigning them to members in a rotating manner to ensure fairness and distribution of tasks.
-   **Unified Calendar View:** Offers a centralized calendar interface that clearly displays scheduled chores and upcoming expense deadlines, providing a visual overview of household responsibilities and financial obligations.
-   Shared Expense Logging: Record shared expenses with amounts, descriptions, dates, payers, and participants. The split can be equal or custom.
-   Balance and Settlement Dashboard: Display net balances per member and provide settlement suggestions to minimize the number of transactions.
-   **Shared Expense Logging:** Enables members to easily record shared expenses, including details like the amount, a description, the date of the expense, who paid, and which members participated. The application supports both equal splitting and custom split configurations.
-   **Balance and Settlement Dashboard:** Presents a clear overview of each member's net balance within the household. It intelligently suggests efficient settlement plans to minimize the number of transactions required to balance the accounts.
-   **AI-Powered Chore and Expense Optimization:** Utilizes machine learning models via Genkit to provide intelligent suggestions for optimizing chore schedules based on member availability and historical completion data. It also suggests fair and efficient ways to split expenses. The AI tool mentioned in the blueprint is likely used for training and adapting these models based on user feedback and patterns.
